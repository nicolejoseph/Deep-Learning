# Image Classifier
Trained an image classifier for the CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets, which contain 32Ã—32 pixel color images. For the CIFAR10 dataset, I first used the Keras sequential API to train a Convolutional Neural Network. However, the resulting accuracy was around 50%. I switched to a Residual Neural Network and the resulting accuracy was 83.42%. Success! The ResNet is composed of residual blocks, which contain skip connections that add identity mappings from one point in the network to a forward point. This optimized the deep neural network and resulted in good validation and testing accuracies.
For the CIFAR100 dataset, I set up my ResNet similarly. Without data augmentation, the model did not perform well. Using Keras ImageDataGenerator, augmentations such as rotation, scale transformation, and translation helped increase the diversity of the training data.
