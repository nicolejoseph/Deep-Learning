# Multi Layer Perceptron
Performed binary classification on the spirals dataset using a multi-layer perceptron. Generated the spirals data myself. Imposed an L2 penalty on the set of parameters. Experimented with combining various activation functions for the input and hidden layers.
The plot produced shows the examples and the boundary
corresponding to p(t = 1 | x) = 0.5.
