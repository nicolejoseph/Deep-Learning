# Convolutional Neural Network
Classified MNIST digits with a convolutional neural network. Achieved 99% accuracy on the test set.The MNIST dataset consists of 50,000 training images, and 10,000 test images. Each instance is a 28 Ã— 28 pixel handwritten digit zero through nine. Additionally, I used a validation set, dropout, and an L2 penalty for regularization in my implementation.
Shown below is the model summary of my CNN.
